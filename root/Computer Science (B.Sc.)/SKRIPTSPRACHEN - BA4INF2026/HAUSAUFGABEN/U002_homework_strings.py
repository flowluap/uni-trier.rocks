NLTK
    1) (Try to) Create a corpus (of files in english!) of your own choosing. A single file is enough,
    use more if you want.
    2) How many token are in your corpus?
    3) How many types are in your corpus?
    4) At home: Experiment more with your corpus and the NLTK to get used to it. You may use the examples from
    presentation 02, you may consult the NLTK book/homepage and use their examples.

of the books would have one think. It is due to the brain's capacity to make use of the information conveyed to it 
by a narrow band of visible light rays. His CIVILIZATION, all that he had achieved or might achieve, hung upon his 
ability to perceive that range of vibrations from red to violet. Without that, he was lost."""

the circumstances. Nobody can ever see what a major discovery is going to lead to whether it is a new kind of engine 
or a triffid and we coped with them all right in normal conditions. We benefited quite a lot from them, as long 
as the conditions were to their disadvantage."""
