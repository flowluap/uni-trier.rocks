# I use a lot of exit(), the script stops once it reaches one that isn't part of a comment
# You can replace all "exit()" with "exit()" by pressing CTRL + R and use "Replace all"
# Please don't use "# exit()"
# The idea of this file is to give you some examples we can test and discuss in real time, so that you understand them
# and can use them and experiment with them at home.


"""Comments"""
# This is a single line comment that is ignored by the interpreter and doesn't allocate memory

"""This is
a
multiline
comment"""
# Strictly speaking this is WRONG. Stuff inside triple quotation marks is not ignored by the interpreter and does
# allocate memory until the garbage collection frees the memory again. This happens when the code is executed and the
# string isn't assigned to a variable.
# However, this is the way to document within code. When this multiline is placed immediately after a function or
# class definition or on top of a module, garbage collection will ignore it. Such a case is called docstring(s).
